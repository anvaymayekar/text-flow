pride and prejudice by jane austen
it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters
my dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last
mr bennet replied that he had not
but it is returned she for mrs long has just been here and she told me all about it
mr bennet made no answer
do you not want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently
you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it
this was invitation enough
why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england
that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately
that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week
what is his name
bingley
is he married or single
oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year
what a fine thing for our girls
how so how can it affect them
my dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them
is that his design in settling here
design nonsense how can you talk so
but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes
i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley may like you the best of the party
my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now
when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty
in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of
but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood
it is more than i engage for i assure you
but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would be for one of them
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no newcomers
indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not
you are over scrupulous surely
i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls
though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy
i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the others
and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia
but you are always giving her the preference
they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls
but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters
mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way
you take delight in vexing me you have no compassion for my poor nerves
you mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves
they are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least
ah you do not know what i suffer
but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood
it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them
depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character
her mind was less difficult to develop
she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous
the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley
he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go
and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it
it was then disclosed in the following manner
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with
i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy
we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit
but you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him
i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces of her own
she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her
no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you
mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters
don t keep coughing so kitty for heaven s sake have a little compassion on my nerves
you tear them to pieces
kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill
i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully
when is your next ball lizzy
to morrow fortnight
aye so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come back till the day before
so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself
then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to her
impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself
how can you be so teasing
i honour your circumspection a fortnight s acquaintance is certainly very little
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight
but if we do not venture somebody else will
and after all mrs long and her daughters must stand their chance
and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself
the girls stared at their father mrs bennet said only nonsense nonsense
what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he
do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense
i cannot quite agree with you there
what say you mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts
mary wished to say something sensible but knew not how
while she is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr bingley
i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife
i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me that before
if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him
it was very unlucky that you should have used such very strong expressions if i had known your feelings
you said the other day that you thought him quite disagreeable said elizabeth
elizabeth you know nothing of the matter
oh you are a great deal too apt to like people in general
you never see a fault in anybody
all the world are good and agreeable in your opinion
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life
i would i could say the same of you my dear
but i have always observed that first impressions are of the greatest importance
you understand me perfectly i am sure
but remember my dear friend that we must be careful not to read more into a situation than actually exists
the art of being a human being is to understand when to trust and when to be cautious
perhaps mr bingley will turn out to be everything we hope and more
or perhaps he will disappoint us as many people do when we get to know them better
only time will tell what kind of man he truly is
but i do think it would be wise to approach this situation with both optimism and prudence
after all the happiness of our daughters is at stake
and that is something we must take very seriously indeed
for what parent would not want the best possible future for their children
these are the thoughts that keep me awake at night sometimes
wondering if i am doing right by my girls
wondering if i am preparing them well for the world they will face
the world can be a harsh place for women without proper connections
and so we must be strategic in how we navigate these social waters
i only hope that i have taught them well enough to make good choices
choices that will bring them happiness and security in equal measure
for that is what every parent wants for their child is it not
to see them happy and safe and well provided for
these are simple wishes but so difficult to achieve in practice
especially when there are five daughters to consider
each with her own temperament and her own particular needs
jane is so gentle and trusting perhaps too trusting at times
elizabeth is clever and independent but sometimes too quick to judge
mary is studious but perhaps lacks the social graces that are so important
kitty is easily influenced and follows lydia in everything
and lydia is wild and thoughtless and causes me constant worry
how does one parent five such different girls
how does one prepare them all for happiness when they are so unlike
it is a puzzle that occupies my mind constantly
and mr bingley represents hope for at least one of them
hope for a good marriage and a secure future
hope for the kind of happiness that every mother wants for her daughter
so yes i am interested in mr bingley very interested indeed
not because i am mercenary but because i am practical
because i understand the realities of life for women in our society
because i want my girls to have choices and opportunities
and a good marriage can provide both
this is why i push mr bennet to be social
this is why i worry about these things
because someone must and he seems content to leave it all to chance
but chance is a poor provider for young women
planning and effort and careful attention to opportunities
these are what secure good futures for daughters
and so i will continue to hope and plan and worry
until all my girls are safely and happily settled
it is my job as their mother and i take it seriously
even if others think me silly for doing so
even if my own husband mocks my concerns
i know what is important and i will not be deterred
the future happiness of five young women depends on my vigilance
and i will not fail them if i can possibly help it
this is my solemn promise to myself and to them
to do everything in my power to secure their wellbeing
for what else is a mother for if not this

to kill a mockingbird by harper lee
when i was almost six and jem was nearly ten our summer caper came to an end
a summer caper that lasted three summers in succession and gave us our first real contact with evil
we were far too old to settle an argument with a fist fight so we consulted atticus
our father was a lawyer and his word was law
he told us that mockingbirds dont do one thing but make music for us to enjoy
they dont eat up peoples gardens dont nest in corncribs they dont do one thing but sing their hearts out for us
thats why its a sin to kill a mockingbird
that was the only time i ever heard atticus say it was a sin to do something
he would tell us that we must never take unfair advantage of another person
that we must always try to see things from their point of view
that we must walk in their shoes before we judge them
these lessons came to us gradually over the years of our childhood
sometimes through direct instruction but more often through example
atticus was a man who practiced what he preached
he treated everyone with dignity and respect regardless of their station in life
he spoke to the black housekeeper calpurnia as he spoke to his white neighbors
he listened to children with the same attention he gave to adults
he never raised his voice in anger or spoke in haste
when tom robinson came to trial atticus defended him with everything he had
not because he expected to win but because it was the right thing to do
he knew the town would turn against him for taking the case
he knew his children would face ridicule and worse
but he could not live with himself if he did not do his duty
the trial opened our eyes to things we had never seen before
we learned that our quiet little town harbored deep prejudices
we learned that good people could do terrible things
we learned that justice was not always served
we learned that courage comes in many forms
mrs dubose was a morphine addict who fought her addiction alone
she was mean and spiteful but she had her own kind of bravery
boo radley was the neighborhood phantom
the subject of countless stories and childhood fears
but when the time came he proved to be our guardian angel
the night bob ewell attacked us as we walked home from the school pageant
boo emerged from his house for the first time in years to save us
he carried jem home after the attack
he stayed to make sure we were safe
then he faded back into the shadows like a ghost
standing on his porch later that night i tried to see the world through his eyes
i looked out at the neighborhood where he had spent his entire life watching
watching the children play and grow and change
watching the seasons come and go
watching the small dramas of ordinary life unfold
from his window he had seen it all
he had seen us as we played our games in his yard
he had watched us struggle with the mysteries of growing up
he had observed our father as he went about his daily business
and somehow in watching he had come to care
care enough to leave us small gifts in the oak tree
care enough to mend jems pants when they got caught on the fence
care enough to risk everything to save us when we needed him
it was then that i began to understand what atticus had been trying to teach us
about seeing people as they really are
about understanding their circumstances and their choices
about treating everyone with compassion and kindness
the summer i turned eight our lives changed forever
but we learned lessons that would stay with us always
we learned that the world is not always fair
but that we must still try to do what is right
we learned that courage is not a man with a gun in his hand
but someone who faces adversity with integrity
we learned that you cant really understand a person
until you consider things from their point of view
until you climb inside their skin and walk around in it
these lessons came at a cost
the loss of innocence is always painful
but they made us better people in the end
they prepared us to face a world that is not always kind
with wisdom and compassion and strength
scout finch grew up that summer
grew up in ways that changed her forever
but she grew up with the foundation her father had given her
the foundation of doing right regardless of the consequences
of standing up for what you believe in
of treating every person with dignity and respect
these are the gifts atticus finch gave his children
these are the lessons that transcended time and place
lessons about what it means to be human
what it means to live with integrity
what it means to make choices based on principle rather than convenience
the mockingbird sang its heart out in the darkness
sang without thought of reward or recognition
sang simply because that was its nature
and in learning not to kill the mockingbird
scout and jem learned not to destroy the good in others
not to let cynicism and hatred win
not to give up on the possibility of justice and kindness
even in a world that often seems to reward neither
the mockingbird became a symbol of all that is innocent and good
all that deserves protection and nurturing
all that makes life worth living
and in protecting the mockingbird
we protect the best parts of ourselves
the parts that sing in the darkness
the parts that hope against hope
the parts that choose love over fear
again and again
no matter how difficult the choice might be
this is the legacy of atticus finch
this is the gift he gave his children and through them to all of us
the understanding that we must be better than our circumstances
that we must rise above the prejudices and fears that surround us
that we must choose to see the good in others
even when it is hard to find
even when the world tells us not to look
the summer ended but the lessons remained
carved into the hearts of two children
who learned that growing up means learning to see clearly
learning to choose wisely
learning to love deeply
despite everything that would make us do otherwise
this is what it means to kill a mockingbird
to destroy the innocent song that rises from the human heart
to silence the voice that speaks of hope and possibility
to give in to the darkness that would make us less than we are
and this is why we must never do it
why we must protect the mockingbird in ourselves and others
why we must keep singing our own songs of hope
no matter how dark the night becomes
no matter how long the silence lasts
the song will rise again
because that is what mockingbirds do
they sing their hearts out for us
they remind us of beauty and goodness
they keep alive the possibility
that tomorrow might be better than today
hamlet by william shakespeare
to be or not to be that is the question
whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
or to take arms against a sea of troubles
and by opposing end them to die to sleep
no more and by a sleep to say we end
the heartache and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to tis a consummation
devoutly to be wished to die to sleep
to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub
for in that sleep of death what dreams may come
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil
must give us pause theres the respect
that makes calamity of so long life
for who would bear the whips and scorns of time
the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely
the pangs of despised love the laws delay
the insolence of office and the spurns
that patient merit of the unworthy takes
when he himself might his quietus make
with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear
to grunt and sweat under a weary life
but that the dread of something after death
the undiscovered country from whose bourn
no traveler returns puzzles the will
and makes us rather bear those ills we have
than fly to others that we know not of
thus conscience does make cowards of us all
and thus the native hue of resolution
is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought
and enterprises of great pitch and moment
with this regard their currents turn awry
and lose the name of action
hamlet prince of denmark stood upon the battlements of elsinore
contemplating the weight of existence and the burden of revenge
his fathers ghost had appeared to him in the dead of night
revealing the truth of his murder at the hands of claudius
his own brother who had seized both crown and queen
the revelation shattered hamlets world completely
leaving him torn between duty and doubt
between action and contemplation
between the demands of honor and the uncertainty of truth
he questioned everything including his own sanity
was the ghost real or a figment of his troubled mind
was he bound by honor to avenge his father
or was he being manipulated by forces beyond his understanding
these questions tormented him day and night
driving him to the edge of madness
or perhaps beyond it into a realm where sanity and insanity blurred
he tested those around him with elaborate schemes
feigning madness to discover the truth
staging plays to observe the guilty reactions of the king
all while struggling with the weight of what he had learned
ophelia bore the brunt of his torment
innocent and pure she became a casualty of his internal war
her love for him could not withstand the storm of his anguish
and when her father polonius fell victim to hamlets sword
mistaken for the king behind a tapestry
her fragile mind finally broke completely
she wandered the castle speaking in riddles and songs
distributing flowers with meanings only she understood
until the waters of the brook claimed her
ending her suffering but adding to the weight on hamlets soul
the court of elsinore became a place of suspicion and fear
where every word was measured and every action scrutinized
where loyalty was uncertain and betrayal lurked in every shadow
claudius knew that hamlet posed a threat
but could not move openly against the popular prince
so he plotted and schemed using others as his instruments
rosencrantz and guildenstern childhood friends of hamlet
were enlisted to spy upon him
but hamlet saw through their deception easily
his wit sharp even in his apparent madness
laertes returned from france burning for revenge
his father dead his sister mad
he too sought satisfaction for wrongs done to his family
claudius used his rage as a weapon against hamlet
arranging the fatal duel that would end it all
but even the best laid plans can go awry
and the poison meant for hamlet claimed other victims
the queen unknowing drank the poisoned cup
laertes and hamlet both fell to the poisoned sword
and claudius too met his end at hamlets hand
in the end the prince of denmark achieved his revenge
but at a cost that emptied the kingdom of its royal line
fortinbras of norway arrived to find a court in ruins
the strong and decisive prince that hamlet might have been
if fate and circumstance had been kinder
the tragedy of hamlet lies not just in the deaths
but in the waste of potential
in the destruction of innocence
in the way that one act of evil
can spread like poison through an entire kingdom
corrupting everything it touches
destroying not just the guilty but the innocent as well
hamlet was a man of thought in a world that demanded action
a philosopher forced to be a warrior
a lover of truth trapped in a web of lies
his tragedy was that he saw too clearly
understood too much
felt too deeply
in a world that rewarded neither wisdom nor sensitivity
his delay in seeking revenge
has been debated by scholars for centuries
was it cowardice or wisdom
was it madness or the highest sanity
perhaps it was simply the natural response
of a thoughtful man faced with an impossible choice
the ghost of his father demanded justice
but what if the ghost was evil
what if revenge would damn his soul
these were not idle philosophical questions for hamlet
they were matters of eternal consequence
and so he hesitated and questioned and tested
until events forced his hand
and by then it was too late
for himself and for those he loved
the play within the play became a mirror
reflecting the corruption of the entire court
actors pretending to be characters
while the real characters played their own roles
in a drama they did not fully understand
reality and illusion became indistinguishable
truth and falsehood blurred together
until no one could be certain of anything
except that something was rotten in the state of denmark
and that rot had spread too far to be easily cut out
the graveyard scene with yorick the jester
brought hamlet face to face with mortality
the skull of a man who had once made him laugh
now reduced to bone and dust
a reminder that all human achievement
all human suffering
all human striving
ends in the same place
in the democracy of death
where king and beggar lie side by side
this memento mori gave hamlet a kind of peace
a perspective that transcended immediate concerns
and prepared him for the final act of his tragedy
in the end hamlet achieved a nobility in death
that had eluded him in life
facing his fate with courage and grace
asking horatio to tell his story truly
so that his struggles might not be forgotten
his example might serve as a warning
his questions might continue to be pondered
by those who come after
for the questions hamlet asked
are eternal questions
that each generation must answer for itself
how do we live with integrity in a corrupt world
how do we act decisively when truth is uncertain
how do we balance thought with action
love with duty
justice with mercy
these are the riddles that make us human
and hamlet in wrestling with them
became the most human of all shakespeares characters
flawed and struggling
brilliant and tormented
noble and tragic
a mirror in which we see ourselves
and the eternal human condition

the origin of species by charles darwin
when on board hms beagle as naturalist i was much struck with certain facts
in the distribution of the inhabitants of south america
and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent
these facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species
that mystery of mysteries as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers
on my return home it occurred to me in eighteen thirty eight
that something might perhaps be made out on this question
by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts
which could possibly have any bearing on it
after five years work i allowed myself to speculate on the subject
and drew up some short notes
these i enlarged in eighteen forty four into a sketch of the conclusions
which then seemed to me probable
from that period to the present day i have steadily pursued the same object
i hope that i may be excused for entering on these personal details
as i give them to show that i have not been hasty in coming to a decision
my work is now nearly finished
it consists of a series of notes carefully collected during a long period
the facts have been observed in various countries
and have been confirmed by repeated observations
i have endeavored to trace the variations which occur in different species
and to compare them with the relations of their geographical distribution
i have considered the influence of climate and of various other circumstances
and i have examined the effect of competition between species
the struggle for existence is most severe in densely populated areas
and in all cases the strongest and best adapted individuals survive
the weaker and less adapted are gradually destroyed
i have seen many instances of adaptation in animals and plants
where certain characters have been favored by the conditions of life
these observations confirm the view that natural selection is the main agency
by which species are modified in the course of long periods
i have also collected facts from domesticated animals
where selection by man shows a parallel process
many of these variations are inherited and transmitted to offspring
i have found that even small differences may accumulate over many generations
and eventually lead to considerable changes in structure
the fossil record provides additional evidence for gradual change
though it is often imperfect and incomplete
i have observed the succession of species in different geological formations
and noted the appearance of new forms and the disappearance of old ones
the facts from embryology and development support the view of common descent
similarities in structure point to a common origin of widely different species
comparative anatomy also shows patterns of modification over time
the distribution of species on islands is particularly instructive
they often resemble those of the nearest continent
but exhibit unique variations not found elsewhere
i have found that migration and isolation contribute to the formation of new species
hybridization sometimes produces intermediate forms
but often hybrids are infertile or less viable
the principle of divergence is evident in many groups of organisms
as species adapt to different ecological niches
the modification of parts is correlated with changes in habits and function
i have also considered the influence of sexual selection
where traits favored by mate choice are perpetuated
these principles together provide a coherent explanation
for the diversity and adaptation of life on earth
i have tried to follow a strictly scientific method
relying on observation evidence and reasoned argument
i have avoided speculation beyond what the facts support
the history of life on earth is long and complex
and requires patient accumulation of evidence
my notes include detailed observations of plants insects and vertebrates
i have corresponded with naturalists in different parts of the world
to verify my observations and gather additional data
the conclusion that species are not immutable has been difficult for many to accept
but the evidence in favor of change through natural selection is overwhelming
i hope that these notes will contribute to a better understanding
of the origin of species and the processes of adaptation
these studies show that life is dynamic and constantly changing
and that the forms we see today are the result of long histories of modification
